### Relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input
In this case there was no bug, as there were no problems with the computer itself, however there was symptoms when the program was ran, which had nothing to do with a failure-inducing input as the test-file contained inputs that were of legal argument. The symptom in this case was a problem in the code in which it threw a `Java heap space` error which was resolved by indicated where the `currentIndex` should be after adding a link.
